# Pizza Sales Data Analysis
This repository showcases the end-to-end analysis of pizza sales data, covering data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Microsoft Excel, PostgreSQL, and Power BI.

# Project Overview
## Data Cleaning  
- Cleaned raw pizza sales data using Microsoft Excel to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency in the dataset.
## Data Analysis 
- Utilized PostgreSQL for:
Writing SQL queries to calculate key metrics like total sales, monthly trends, and category-wise sales.
Performing advanced operations such as filtering, grouping, and aggregations.
## Data Visualization
- Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize:
Monthly sales trends.
Sales distribution by pizza categories.
Insights into top-performing items and sales performance.
